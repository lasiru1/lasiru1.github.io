                33 years old, born and raised in Southern California. After living in Los Angeles
                and Orlando, I'm happy to call San Diego my home. Passionate STEM advocate, Trail 
                Runner, MTG EDH is my happy place. I enjoy traveling and finding the best food spots
                in SD. I've been studying Japanese since 2018 and making it a life mission to visit 
                every city in Japan. すごい！ My skillset includes real-time embedded systems, FPGA 
                design, embedded Linux, and software tools for aviation and medical certification 
                DO-178C / IEC 62304. Core areas of interest include quantum computing, electric 
                vehicles, cryptocurrency, robotics, and sustainability. Former Senior Engineer at 
                Wind River Systems. Proud alumni of UC San Diego and Riverside City College.

            <a href="https://github.com/lasiru1/truck-detector">Truck Detector</a> (1/10 Scale Autonomous Vehicle)
            <ul>
                <li>Used OpenCV to train a neural network modeled RC car to drive along a track in autopilot and automatically disengage when a truck is confidently labeled from continuous image input processing.</li>
                <li>NVIDIA Jetson Nano was used for ML processing, OAK-D stereo camera & LiDAR sensors for image capturing.</li>
                <li>Used ROS2 algorithms (publisher & subscriber nodes); utilized Donkey Simulator to train reinforcement models.</li>
                <li>Built OpenCV from source; utilized YOLO algorithm on COCO dataset to train our Deep Neural Network model.</li>
                <li>GPU supercluster trained model on thousands of images taken during track runs; autopilot mode mapped real-time environment data to steering angle and velocity, combined with real-time object detection using DNN models.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <a href="https://devpost.com/software/prospect">Prospect</a> (Travel & Health Mobile App)
            <ul>
                <li>Prototyped a travel-logging app that recommends safe travel destinations based on COVID-19 data; completed during a 36-hour hackathon in a team of four, utilized Figma and data queries to demonstrate proof-of-concept.</li>
                <li>Developed back-end using Spring Boot web framework with PostgreSQL database for storing/processing GPS data.</li>
                <li>Implemented JSON parser for more efficient data collecting; initiated a GraphQL prototype for UI map coloring.</li>
            </ul>
